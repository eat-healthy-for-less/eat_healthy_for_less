 * Spending too much money on groceries?

 * Worried about you and your kids eating right?

### About Us

The Eat Healthy for Less project was just a crazy idea on the morning of
Saturday June 1, but a pickup team of developers at the Google Hack for
Change 2013 hackathon turned it into a winning app in just 48 hours!

Meet the team:

 * Trey Smith. Systems Scientist, Carnegie Mellon University Silicon
   Valley / NASA Ames. Project lead and Django-naut. "Eat Healthy for
   Less really just turns what my Mom taught me about grocery shopping
   into an app to help others learn the same techniques."

 * Jason Mow. Student at University of Pennsylvania. Front end,
   integration, and demo lead.

 * Sid Askary. Coder, data wrangler, and outreach.

 * Ganesh Sarwate. Coder and data wrangler. Ganesh wasn't satisfied
   with winning the hackathon and went straight into coding up a
   native Android app on Sunday night!

 * Kenneth Ng. Coder and mobile web guy.

 * Joseph Victor. Stanford University. Coder and algorithms guy.

 * Samer Buna. Coder and data wrangler.

 * Nandita Garud. Coder.

 * Chuang Wang. Coder.
